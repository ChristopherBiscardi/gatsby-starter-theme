3 directories, 10 files
```

### gatsby-theme-minimal

This directory is the theme package itself. You should rename this at
some point to be `gatsby-theme-my-theme-name`. Also change the
`package.json` name field and the corresponding dependency in the
example directory's `package.json`/`gatsby-config.js`.

- `gatsby-theme-minimal/`
  - gatsby-config.js
    An empty gatsby-config that you can use as a starting point for
    building functionality into your theme.
  - index.js
    Since themes also function as plugins, this is an empty file that
    gatsby needs to use this theme as a plugin.
  - package.json
    The dependencies that your theme will pull in when people install
    it. `gatsby` should be a `peerDependency`.

### gatsby-theme-minimal-example

This is an example usage of your theme. It should look the same as the
site of someone who installed and used your theme from npm.

- `gatsby-theme-minimal-example/`
  - gatsby-config.js
    Specifies which theme to use and any other one-off config a site
    might need.
  - src/
    source code such as one-off pages or components that might live in
    a user's site.
